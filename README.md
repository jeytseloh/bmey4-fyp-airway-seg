## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Overview
Pulmonary airway segmentation is vital for the diagnosis and prognosis of lung diseases, but manual segmentation of airways is labour-intensive for clinicians. Recent advancements in automatic segmentation methods have introduced various loss functions tailored for airway segmentation, which are essential for guiding deep learning models. Although various studies have studied and compared loss functions in medical image segmentation, none have specifically focused on airway segmentation. Most existing methods in airway segmentation have been proposed and evaluated with different network architectures and datasets, making comparison and benchmarking difficult.

Additionally, it has been shown that models trained on "clean" healthy data struggle to generalise to "noisy" pathological data. With the recent release of large public benchmark datasets, specifically the ATM'22 and AeroPath datasets, we can better assess the robustness and generalisability of various state-of-the-art methods.

Furthermore, this study explores the application of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a highly generalisable and adaptable vision Foundation Model (FM), to airway segmentation. Although adaptations of SAM for medical imaging analysis have been evaluated on a wide range of segmentation tasks, few have tackled its application on treelike structures such as airways and vessels.

Therefore, the objectives of the project are summarised as follows:
- To investigate the effect of dataset distributions on the robustness and generalisability of a trained model.
- To perform a comparative analysis of various loss functions proposed for airway segmentation.
- To benchmark the performance and capacity of proposed medical SAM adaptations with and without fine-tuning on airway segmentation.

### üí° Investigating Dataset Distribution for the Robustness and Generalisability of a Model
| **Dataset**       | **Number of Cases** |
|:---|:---:|
| ATM'22            |         239         |
| AeroPath          |          21         |
| ATM'22 + AeroPath |         260         |

**A large dataset with a good representation of true (healthy) airway structures is key for model robustness and generalisability.**

- **Loss functions incorporating topological prior knowledge such as airway centrelines outperform generic overlap-based loss functions (e.g., Dice loss).**
- **From our experiments, CAS loss performed best, particularly in topology-based metrics (i.e., TD, BD, and CCF).**

- **The performance of medical adaptations of SAM is generally inferior to state-of-the-art specialist methods for airway segmentation, but fine-tuning with airway segmentation data can improve the performance of medical SAMs.**
- **Nonetheless, further advancements are required before practical application is feasible.**
